A recommendation system is a type of information filtering technology that seeks to predict the rating or preference a user would give to an item, based on their past behavior or preferences. Here's a detailed overview:
Types of Recommendation Systems:
Content-Based Filtering (CBF): Recommends items with similar attributes to the ones a user has liked or interacted with in the past.
Collaborative Filtering (CF): Recommends items based on the behavior or preferences of similar users.
Hybrid: Combines CBF and CF techniques.
